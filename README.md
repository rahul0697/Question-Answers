# Question-Answers
# Why is cosine similarity better in measuring similarity between vectors than Euclidean in Vector Space model?
1. Euclidean distance is not a good measure of similarity in high dimension.
2. Cosine similarity is generally used as a metric for measuring distance when the magnitude of the vectors does not matter.
3. Cosine similarity is specialized in handling scale/length effects, like the word count of  same word in different document.

## Parametric vs Non Parametric Classifier
Parametric Classifier : Decision Surface which classifier will learn is already known to us. Works well with small data also
 1. Linear Regression
 2. Logistic Regression 
 3. Perceptron  
Non-Parametric Classifier : Decision surface is not known, we learn it from the data. Large Data -> better decision Surface  
For example:  
1 .Deep Neural Network  
2 .SVM(Kernels)  
3 .KNN  
4 .Decision Tree
