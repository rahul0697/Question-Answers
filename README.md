# Question-Answers
# Why is cosine similarity better in measuring similarity between vectors than Euclidean in Vector Space model?
1. Euclidean distance is not a good measure of similarity in high dimension.
2. Cosine similarity is generally used as a metric for measuring distance when the magnitude of the vectors does not matter.
3. Cosine similarity is specialized in handling scale/length effects, like the word count of  same word in different document.
