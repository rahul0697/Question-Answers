### Cosine vs Euclidean Distance 
> Why is cosine similarity better in measuring similarity between vectors than Euclidean in Vector Space model? 
 - Euclidean distance is not a good measure of similarity in high dimension. 
 - Cosine similarity is generally used as a metric for measuring distance when the magnitude of the vectors does not matter. 
 - Cosine similarity is specialized in handling scale/length effects, like the word count of  same word in different document.

### Parametric vs Non Parametric Classifier
> Parametric Classifier : Decision Surface is known. Small dataset is not a problem here.
 - Linear Regression
 - Logistic Regression 
 - Perceptron  
> Non-Parametric Classifier : Decision surface is not known, we learn it from the data. Large Data -> better decision Surface  
- Deep Neural Network  
- SVM(Kernels)  
- KNN  
- Decision Tree
